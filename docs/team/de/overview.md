## The mission

The Data Engineering team's mission is to design, build and maintain the data infrastructures and pipelines that provide the entire organization with reliable, accessible and up-to-date data. In concrete terms, this means connecting the various sources of data (internal or external), transforming them to make them usable, and exposing them in a form that can be understood and reused by product, business, data science or analysis teams.

Our role is often invisible, but essential: we lay the technical rails that enable data to flow smoothly, securely and in a documented way. We ensure data quality, traceability and governance, while facilitating the autonomy of other teams in its use.

Our ultimate goal: to enable every team to make informed decisions, build data-driven products and innovate based on a solid, well-structured database.

The aim of this documentation is to present the work of the Data Engineering team at pass Culture, with an emphasis on **understanding the tools, processes and data flows in place**. It is aimed primarily at non-technical profiles (product, operations, internal partners), with a view to transparency, collaboration and increasing competence on data subjects.

We describe how data is collected, transformed, stored and displayed, as well as the tools we use on a daily basis. The idea is to **make visible the technical foundations** underpinning the products and analyses you use, without going into implementation details.

You'll also find diagrams to visualize the architectures, explanations of the roles of each tool, and links to more technical resources if you'd like to delve deeper into certain subjects. This documentation is living, and will be enriched over time according to the needs and evolution of our stack.
