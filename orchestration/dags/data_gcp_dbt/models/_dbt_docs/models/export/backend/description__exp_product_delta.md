# Table: Product Delta

The `product_delta` table contains the list of products (identified by EAN) and their parsed data that must be synchronized with the backend application.

This model specifically filters for products where the `support code` contains alphabetic characters, to targeting physical books.

{% enddocs %}

## Key Concepts

- **Delta Generation**: This table is regenerated daily based on the `snapshot` history and the last successful synchronization timestamp recorded in `local_provider_event`.
- **Target Consumer**: Primarily used by the backend system to perform incremental updates (UPSERTs) on its product database.

## Table Description

This section would typically display the auto-generated schema from dbt docs.
