# Table: Venue Removed

This model exports venues removed data for ministry use. It contains only removed venues not longer available for booking in pass Culture apps. Non-permanent venues have been switched to permanent ones in August 2025.
At the time they were deleted, these venues did not have any active or bookable offer.
