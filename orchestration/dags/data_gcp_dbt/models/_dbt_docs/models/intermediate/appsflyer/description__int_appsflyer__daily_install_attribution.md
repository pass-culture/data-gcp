The `int_appsflyer__daily_install_attribution` table aggregates user event data from the AppsFlyer platform, selecting the most recent version for each combination of app_install_date and acquisition_days_post_attribution. It consolidates data on app installations, user registrations, and beneficiary metrics, offering a comprehensive view of user acquisition performance. By capturing advertising campaign details such as media sources, campaign names, and ad-level breakdowns, this model provides insights for evaluating user engagement across different acquisition channels. The defined attribution window allows for focused analysis of early user behaviors and campaign effectiveness within a 14-day post-installation period.
