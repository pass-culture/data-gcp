{% docs description__int_finance__cashflow %}

The `int_finance__cashflow` table represents monetary movements between Pass Culture's bank account and an offerer's bank account.

## Business Context

Cashflows are generated by the `generate_cashflows_and_payment_files` cron that runs at 5:00 UTC on the 1st and 16th of each month. They group valorisations by bank account to determine the total reimbursement amount for each wire transfer.

## Cashflow Status Lifecycle

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | After cashflow creation |
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | After payment files generation |
| `ACCEPTED` | After reimbursement receipt generation |

## Prerequisites for Reimbursement

For a venue's bookings to be reimbursed, it must:
1. Have a **pricing point** (for valorisation)
2. Be linked to a **validated bank account** (for cashflow generation)

A structure can have multiple bank accounts. A bank account can be referenced by multiple venues.
