{% docs description__int_finance__invoice %}

The `int_finance__invoice` table contains reimbursement receipts generated when wire transfers are confirmed.

## Business Context

Invoices (justificatifs de remboursement) are generated by the `generate_invoices` command after cashflow generation. A CSV summary file (`invoices.csv`) is deposited on Google Drive for accounting purposes.

<!-- TODO: Clarify the exact relationship between Invoice and other entities (Cashflow, BankAccount) -->
