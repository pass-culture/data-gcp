{% docs description__int_seed__priority_urban_district %}

The `priority_urban_district` table contains data on areas defined as priority neighborhoods under France's urban policy (QPV) from [INSEE's 2014 classification](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/quartiers-prioritaires-de-la-politique-de-la-ville-qpv/)
These neighborhoods are identified as some of the most socio-economically disadvantaged in the country, facing significant challenges such as high unemployment rates, lower income levels, and limited access to services. The table provides essential details about these neighborhoods, including geographical boundaries, administrative codes, and associated municipalities.
