{% docs description__int_seed__qpv %}

The `QPV` table contains data on areas defined as priority neighborhoods under France's urban policy (QPV) from [INSEE's 2014 classification](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/quartiers-prioritaires-de-la-politique-de-la-ville-qpv/)
These neighborhoods are identified as some of the most socio-economically disadvantaged in the country, facing significant challenges such as high unemployment rates, lower income levels, and limited access to services.
