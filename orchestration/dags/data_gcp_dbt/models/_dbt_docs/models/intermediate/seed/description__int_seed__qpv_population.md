{% docs description__int_seed__qpv_population %}

The `qpv_population` table contains data on priority urban districts (QPV) as defined by France's urban policy. These districts are areas identified as having socio-economic disadvantages and requiring targeted public policies. The data is sourced from [INSEE's classification](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/quartiers-prioritaires-de-la-politique-de-la-ville-qpv/).

This table provides information on QPV codes, associated municipalities, administrative divisions, and population details.
