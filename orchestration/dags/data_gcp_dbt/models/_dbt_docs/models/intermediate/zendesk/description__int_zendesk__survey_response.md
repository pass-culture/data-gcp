# Overview

This table contains all survey responses from Zendesk, a customer service software platform that we use to manage support tickets and customer interactions.

## Key Concepts

### Survey Responses
A survey response represents feedback provided by a customer after a support interaction. Each response is linked to a specific ticket and contains:
- A unique survey response ID
- The associated ticket ID
- The customer (requester) and support agent (assignee) IDs
- A satisfaction score
- Timestamps for creation and updates
