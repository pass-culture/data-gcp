# Table: Cultural Partner

The `mrt_global__cultural_partner` table is designed to store information about the cultural partner concept that is between venue and offerer concept.
A cultural partner is an in-house concept created to better record and monitor the activity of cultural institutions and companies registered on the pass Culture.


{% enddocs %}

Cultural partners include all permanent venues (facilities which are opened to the public and belong to the institution) as well as cultural entities which have no permanent venue (which are not open to the public nor belong to the institution).

Example: The Op√©ra National de Paris structure corresponds to 3 institutions opened to the public and therefore 3 cultural partners. The We Love Green Festival corresponds to several non-permanent venues, not owned by the festival, and is therefore a single cultural partner.

A structure can therefore have several cultural partners.
Local authorities are not cultural partners. Only its facilities opened to the public are (library, museum, castle...).
