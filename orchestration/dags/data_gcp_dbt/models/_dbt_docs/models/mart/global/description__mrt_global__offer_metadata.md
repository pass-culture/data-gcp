# Table: Offer Metadata

The `mrt_global__offer_metadata` table is designed to store extensive information about offer metadata that is not directly provided in `Global Offer`.
A lot of columns are only related to one cultural activity.
There is also a lot of legacy columns that might change due to extensive work to improve the quality of our product metadata.

Offer metadata can either be manually provided by cultural partners upon offer creation, or automatically provided for synchronized offers.
For synchronized offers, offer genres for books and music discs draw on the concept of Genre Tite Live (GTL).
Titelive is a French company providing digital solutions for bookstores, publishers, and libraries to manage inventory, sales, and online catalogs.
The concept of "Genre Tite Live" (GTL) refers to a classification system used by Titelive to categorize books and music cds based on their genre, to organize and manage collections more effectively.
The GTL classification system consists of several hierarchical levels to categorize books and music cds, to provide a structured way to organize and retrieve products based on their content and audience.
