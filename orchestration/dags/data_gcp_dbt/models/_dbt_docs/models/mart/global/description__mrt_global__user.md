{% docs description__mrt_global__user %}

The `mrt_global__user` table provides a comprehensive view of individual beneficiaries data, including demographic information, activity status, and engagement metrics. It is designed to support analysis of user behavior and trends over time.


{% enddocs %}

All individual users who received a grant, irrespective of their grant status, are stored here.
Demographic information (address, activity) are purely declarative. They are registered in the user's first grant application process. Users are invited to update those information when applying for a new grant (ie : when 15-17 users turn 18), and they can update those at any time through their app.
