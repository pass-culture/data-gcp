# Table: Venue Model

The `mrt_global__venue` table provides detailed information about venues, including their location, capacity, and associated offers.
A venue is managed by an offerer. It can be a physical place (library, cinema, theater) - owned by the offerer or a performance venue -  or a virtual platform that hosts digital offers (streaming, audios).
It can be represented by a SIRET.

NB : the amount of venues will soon decrease because tech teams are currently regularizing venues : only physical venues belonging to the offerer (which can be performance venues or “administrative” venues) will remain. Activity (offers, reservations, stick) of performance venues that do not belong to the offerer / of digital venues will be transferred to other venues belonging to the offerer.
