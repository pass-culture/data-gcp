# Table: Venue Model

The `mrt_global__venue` table provides detailed information about venues, including their location, capacity, and associated offers.
A venue is managed by an offerer. It can be a physical place (library, cinema, theater) - owned by the offerer or performance venues -  or a virtual platform that proposes digital offers (streaming, audios).
It can be represented by a SIRET.

NB : the amount of venues will soon decrease because tech teams are currently regularizing venues : only locations belonging to the offerer (which can be performance venues or “administrative” venues) will remain. Activity (offers, reservations, stick) of performance venues that do not belong to the offerer / digital venues will be transferred to other venues belonging to the offerer.
