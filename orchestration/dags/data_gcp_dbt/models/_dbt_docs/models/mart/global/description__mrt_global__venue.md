# Table: Venue Model

The `mrt_global__venue` table provides detailed information about venues, including their location, capacity, and associated offers.
A venue is managed by an offerer. It can be a physical place (library, cinema, theater) or a virtual platform that proposes digital offers (streaming, audios).
