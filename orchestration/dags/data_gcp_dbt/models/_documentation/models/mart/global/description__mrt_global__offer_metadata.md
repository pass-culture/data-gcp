# Table: Offer Metadata

The `Offer Metadata` table is designed to store extensive information about offer metadata that is not directly provided in `Global Offer`.
A lot of columns are only related to one cultural activity.
There is also a lot of legacy columns that might change due to extensive work to improve the quality of our product metadata.
