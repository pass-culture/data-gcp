# Table: mrt_global__offer_metadata

The `mrt_global__offer_metadata` table is designed to store extensive information about offer metadata that is not directly provided in `mrt_global__offer`.
A lot of columns are only related to one cultural activity.
There is also a lot of legacy columns that might change due to extensive work to improve the quality of our product metadata.
