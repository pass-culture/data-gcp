These scripts allow us to perform similarity searches, compare data, and automate the matching between unrelated records. For example, one script generates semantic candidates from offer metadata and compares them to existing products to identify potential matches.

The goal is to find those unlinked offers and connect them to the right \"Product\" (like connecting a movie screening to the general information about that movie).</p> <p>They use tools and scripts to do this by:</p> <p>Looking for similarities: Comparing the offer's information (name, description) to existing products to find potential matches. Using external data: Getting more information about the offer from other sources (like APIs) to help with identification. This helps them keep the database organized and make sure all offers are correctly linked to their corresponding products.</p> <p>\u2699\ufe0f Operation</p> <p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Preparing Data for Ingestion into LanceDB</p> <p>This Python script aims to prepare embedding data (vectors representing items) and store it in a LanceDB vector database. It also performs dimensionality reduction of the embeddings if necessary, and then creates a table and an index to facilitate access and search within the embedding vectors. This process involves several steps: loading data from Parquet files stored on Google Cloud Storage (GCS), preprocessing embeddings, creating a database in LanceDB, and indexing for optimized searches.</p> <p>\ud83e\udde0 Candidate Generation</p> <p>This Python script preprocesses embedding data, generates semantic candidates based on embedding similarity, and stores the results as Parquet files in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
